Sometimes they are just not into it.\n\nWhen I was in High School I stayed a week with some friends of my parents that had two young boys.  They lived out of state and I didn't know them very well before staying with them.  So, I just followed them around and observed their lives quietly.\n\nTheir father was really into sports and had pushed both of his boys into T-Ball at an early age.  I went to one of their games while I was with them.  The older boy was the star of the team.  He hit the ball with confidence and ran the bases with a glowing smile, always looking over his shoulder at his Dad when he got a free moment.  He was a champion.  \"That's my boy!\" his Dad would cry.  I remember it vividly.  The younger boy swung his arms lazily at his sides when he ran and stared up at the sky.  He spent most of the game at second base and between hits he would excitedly squat down and make sand castles.  All he wanted was to make sandcastles.  His father was furious.  Yelling at him from the bleachers and ridiculing him all the way home in the car because he didn't try hard enough.  I remember feeling very uncomfortable about the whole thing.  It wasn't my place to say anything, but it was obvious that the kid just wasn't into T-Ball.  But it wasn't that he didn't have interests.  He wanted to create things.  He wanted to look at the world.  Maybe he was just tired.  Maybe he just knew he would never be as good as his older brother, so why even try.  Who knows...  But I knew that not playing his heart out in a T-Ball game didn't change his value.  It was just a stupid game.\n\nI've thought about that moment a lot.  It was probably 20 years ago, and I never really saw their family again after that.  I grew up, had children of my own and told myself that I would never push my children in that way.  I would meet them where they were at and let them have their own interests, and I would force *myself* to be mature and flexible to make my interests the same as theirs, rather than force my interests onto them.\n\nI was sitting on the couch a few years ago, reading a book to my young daughter, when my mother called me on the phone.  It was late and I could tell something was wrong as soon as I answered, so I quickly went to the other room and closed the door.  She told me that her friend's youngest son had killed himself.  He had locked himself in his bedroom with a gun and his mother had found him when she came home that afternoon.  I knelt on the floor and cried.  I hardly knew them.  All I had was less than a week over a decade and a half ago.  But it was as if I could clearly see the past 15 years played out in that one short T-Ball game I had watched so long ago.  I knelt on the floor and cried remembering a young boy with his sandcastles and an angry father.  Then I composed myself, quietly left my room, and went back down the stairs to finish reading a book to my daughter.\n\nParenting is serious business.",
