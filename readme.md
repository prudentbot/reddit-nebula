A test application of [Nebula](https://github.com/prudentbot/nebula) that pulls comments from Reddit.

This is a `npm install` and `npm start` kind of deal.    

Working version here: http://reddit-nebula.herokuapp.com/.  You can click/drag the individual nodes, click/drag the screen to pan, or use the mousewheel to zoom in and out.  Use the magnifying glass at the bottom to change threads.
